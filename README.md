### Hi there 👋

My name is Chaya Cohen. I am Software Engineer with experience in React, Redux, Javascript, Ruby, Rails, Node.js, AWS, Google Maps API, Express.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I have a background in Nursing, having worked full-time as a hospital nurse for four years.  Working as a nurse has taught me tremendous skills that have guided me on my journey as a Software Engineer. I have learned to prioritize time-management, to focus on the details, and to critically think. 

I just completed the curriculum at App Academy, a 1000+ hour bootcamp that is highly intensive and requires efficient and quick learning. One of the projects I've worked on is creating a full stack clone of Airbnb, where users can browse listings as well as host and update their own listings. 

When not coding, you can find me hanging out with my husband and daughter, listening to music, and going on long walks in the park. I love the feeling of constantly growing and I am working on perfecting my skills as a Software Engineer. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](#https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaya-cohen-6a3035142/) or email me at chayac100@gmail.com.
